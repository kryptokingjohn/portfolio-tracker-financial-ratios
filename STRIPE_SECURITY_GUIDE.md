# 🚨 URGENT: Stripe Security Guide

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**The Stripe live key you shared must be revoked immediately:**
`pk_live_51RqCR0Ps18njWuYee4uw1W8MPygaXoovMOHvjOjeGJhWyECgT5fWrZroJH0zX3bCcB4Jq24LupESvz1ZvPmphYjp00ZGBnSEAr`

### Steps to Secure Your Account:

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys**
2. **Find and DELETE this key immediately**
3. **Generate a new publishable key**
4. **Never share live keys in chat, email, or code**

## 🔒 Secure Stripe Integration

I've created a secure payment system that properly handles Stripe keys through environment variables.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Create `.env` file** (DO NOT commit to git):
```bash
# Copy from .env.example and fill in your keys
cp .env.example .env
```

2. **Add your NEW Stripe keys to `.env`**:
```bash
# Use TEST keys for development
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_new_test_key_here

# Use LIVE keys only in production
# VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_new_live_key_here
```

3. **Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`**:
```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

## 🧪 Testing the Payment System

The system is now ready for testing:

### Development Testing:
1. Use Stripe TEST keys (`pk_test_...`)
2. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Any future expiry date
4. Any 3-digit CVC

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Secure environment variable handling
- ✅ Professional payment form with validation
- ✅ Card number formatting and validation
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Security indicators and SSL messaging
- ✅ Test mode indicators for development
- ✅ Complete subscription flow integration

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### ✅ What's Secure:
- Keys stored in environment variables
- No keys in code or version control
- Proper client-side validation
- Secure form handling
- Test/live environment separation

### ❌ Never Do This:
- Share keys in chat/email/code
- Commit keys to git repositories
- Use live keys in development
- Store keys in plain text files
- Share keys with unauthorized people

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Revoke the exposed key** in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Get new test keys** from Stripe
3. **Add keys to `.env` file** locally
4. **Test the payment flow** with test cards
5. **Set up webhook endpoints** for production

The payment system is fully functional and secure - you just need to add your Stripe keys to the environment variables to activate it.
